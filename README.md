This is the modified version of my case study from the Associate Data Scientist Certificate by DataCamp. The original version can be found at https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/6e1faab1-6430-4f94-b3d0-2f18d55b891b.
## Scenario
- I am the Data Scientist at the fitness company which provide five types of fitness classes in Canada, including Yoga, Aqua, Strength, HIIT, and Cycling.
- Finally, the fitness classes schedule is back to normal after the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. However, they have received many complaints from the customers about having a hard time booking a fitness class.
- From initial analysis, the program operation team found out that the fitness classes are always fully booked but are having a low attendance rate per class. To improve this situation, they would like to increase the class capacity for customers to sign up if a low attendance rate is predicted.
